****TODO****

Note : in this script, it still unclear if is it for websites or multpurpose services.
I want a multipurpose services handler but I dont need one right now, so I cant get the time to work on it. 

TODO :
- is this service for web service?
- do we have to put a hook on 80 and/or 443 to force redirection to this service?
(meaning placing a 0.conf in nginx/site-enabled that proxy_pass the request to the service)
example : 
server {

	listen 80;
	...

	location / {
	    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8181
	}

}

- instead shall we put a sub-redirection like : 

server {

	listen 80;
	...

	location /my_service {
	    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8181
	}

}
